Version: 1.0

Status: Draft

Date: September 11, 2025

Author: Gemini

1. Introduction & Vision 💡
   1.1. Problem Statement
   In today's digital world, individuals manage dozens of online accounts, each requiring a password. Users often resort
   to weak, memorable, or reused passwords across multiple services, creating significant security vulnerabilities.
   There is a need for a simple, accessible, and trustworthy tool that empowers users to create strong, random, and
   unique passwords on demand without compromising their privacy.

1.2. Product Vision
To create a fast, intuitive, and secure client-side password generator landing page. The application will serve as a
go-to utility for anyone needing to create a robust password. The core principles are simplicity, security, and user
trust. All operations will be performed in the user's browser, ensuring that no generated passwords are ever transmitted
over the network or stored on a server.

2. Target Audience 👥
   This tool is designed for a broad audience with varying technical skills:

🧑‍💻 The Everyday User: Individuals setting up new online accounts (email, social media, e-commerce) who need a strong
password quickly.

👩‍💼 The Security-Conscious Professional: Developers, IT administrators, and office workers who understand the importance
of unique passwords.

🙋 The Non-Technical User: Individuals who can be guided by a simple UI and clear strength indicators.

3. Functional Requirements & User Stories 📋
   3.1. Core Password Generation (MVP)
   GEN-01: As a user, I want to see a randomly generated password displayed as soon as I land on the page, so I can use
   it immediately with zero clicks.

GEN-02: As a user, I want to click a "Generate" or "Refresh" 🔄 button to get a new password instantly.

GEN-03: As a user, I want to click a "Copy" 📋 button to copy the generated password to my clipboard.

GEN-04: As a user, I want to see a visual confirmation (e.g., "Copied!") when I click the copy button.

3.2. Password Customization Options
CUS-01: As a user, I want to adjust the password length using a slider 🎚️ (e.g., from 8 to 64 characters).

CUS-02: As a user, I want to use checkboxes ☑️ to include or exclude specific character types:

Include Uppercase Letters (A-Z)

Include Lowercase Letters (a-z)

Include Numbers (0-9)

Include Symbols (!@#$%^&*)

CUS-03: As a user, I want the password to regenerate automatically whenever I change a customization option.

3.3. Security & Strength Feedback
SEC-01: As a user, I want to see a visual indicator 📊 (e.g., a colored bar and text like "Weak", "Strong") that rates
the password strength.

SEC-02: As a user, I want assurance that the process is secure. This can be a text block: "✅ All passwords are generated
securely in your browser and are never saved or sent to a server."

4. Non-Functional Requirements ⚙️
   ⚡ Performance: The application must load in under 2 seconds. Generation must be instantaneous.

🔒 Security: Generation must use the browser's window.crypto.getRandomValues() API. No network requests for generation.

📱 Responsiveness: The UI must be fully responsive and work perfectly on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

♿ Accessibility (A11y): Must follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines, be keyboard-navigable, and screen-reader friendly.

Google Lighthouse scores for Performance, Accessibility, and Best Practices consistently above 90.

8. Future Scope (Out of Scope for v1.0) 🔭
   🗣️ Passphrase Generator: Generate memorable passphrases (e.g., "correct-horse-battery-staple").

🌗 Dark/Light Mode: A theme toggle for user preference.

📜 Password History: A temporary, session-only history of generated passwords.

📲 PWA Functionality: Make the application installable and available offline.

Sitemap 🗺️
Since this is a single-page application, the sitemap is very straightforward. It consists of the main page and could
include a standard secondary page for legal information.

/ (Home Page)

Description: The main and only interactive page of the application. It houses the password generator, all its controls,
and displays the result. This is where 100% of the user interaction occurs.

/privacy-policy (Optional but Recommended)

Description: A static page detailing that no user data is stored or transmitted. This helps build the user trust
mentioned as a core principle in the PRD.
